# EBSD Polygonizer: Facilitating Realistic Microstructural Modelling

EBSDPolygonizer is a MATLAB-based app designed to transform EBSD grain data into polygonal representations. In this conversion, each grain is represented by a distinct polygon. This transformation allows for the direct utilization of real microstructures as geometries in finite element (FE) models and  automated assignment of material parameters and boundary conditions to individual grains.
## Features

- **Data Import and Export**: Support text files exported from AztecCrystal, HKL Channel 5 or user-written text file.
- **Polygonization**: Transform raster EBSD data into meaningful polygonized data structures.
- **Plotting**: Plotting capabilities to visualize EBSD maps, neighboring grains, grain boundaries, and vertices.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
